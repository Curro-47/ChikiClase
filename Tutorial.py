## THIS IS A RECAP OF ALL INFORMATION OF ITESM Sem.3 2025-Agu-Dec PYTHON CLASS




######## CODING BASICS #######################################################################################

# - Starting a line with "#" turns it into a comment, the code ignores these lines and allows you to make notes

# - Code runs line by line from top to bottom




######## BASIC FUNCTIONS ############################################################################################

# Print: Outputs text to the terminal (Shows it in the screen)
print("Hello world")
# It is written like "print()" and inside the parenthesis can be a string (text), or a variable

# Input: Asks the user for text
input("Input text: ")



######## VARIABLES, DATA TYPES AND OPERATORS ############################################################################3

######## Variables

# Variables are used to store information
# You create one by writing the name of the variable followed by "=" and the value you want to set to it
variableName = 0
hello = 1203.120
howareyou12 = "HI"
# These are all valid variables

######## Data types

# Variables can have different types, that is: text, number, etc...
# The simplified list (Using variables as examples) is:
int = 123         # Integer numbers
float = 1.2942    # Decimal numbers
string = "Hello"  # Text
boolean = True    # True or false

######## Operators
#### You can use operations to affect each of the data types

# Number operators (int and float)
sum = 1 + 2
substraction = 1 - 2
multiplication = 1 * 2
division = 1 / 2
modulus = 1 % 2 # This gives the residual of its division, for example in 1/2 the residual is 1 so 1%2 = 1

# Text Operators (string)
concatenation = "Hello " + "World" # Combines 2 texts, the result here is "Hello World"

# Boolean Operators (bool)
bool_and = True and False # bool_and will be true if both values are true
bool_or = True or False # bool_or will be true if any value is true

# Comparator (also boolean operators)
equals = 1 == 1 # if the values are equal the variable will be true
equals = "Hello" == "Hello"
equals = False == False

not_equals = 1 != 0 # if the values are not equal the variable will be true
not_equals = "Hello" != "Goodbye"
not_equals = False != True

greater_than = 1 > 0
greater_or_equal_than = 1 >= 0
less_or_equal_than = 0 <= 1
less_than = 0 < 1
